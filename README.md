#VUI Focus [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Desire2Learn-Valence/valence-ui-focus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Desire2Learn-Valence/valence-ui-focus)

This library contains uncompiled LESS and compiled CSS which can be used to
apply an outline style to elements when they receive focus. This accessibility
feature helps identify to the user which element currently has focus.

In most cases, you'll want to use this library on elements which do not already
have a visible or obvious focus indicator. This typically includes links,
checkboxes and radio inputs.
